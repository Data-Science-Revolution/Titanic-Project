## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, I explored the dataset to gain insights into its structure and characteristics. This involved:
Descriptive statistics
Data visualization using tools like Plotly and NLTK
Handling missing values and outliers
understanding the distribution of key variables.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is crucial for enhancing the predictive power of the model. In this project, I performed the following feature engineering tasks:
Handling categorical variables (encoding, creating dummy variables)
Creating new features based on domain knowledge
Scaling or transforming features as needed


## Model Building
I built a predictive model using the best four features identified during the feature engineering phase. The model was implemented using logistics regression from the [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Model evaluation was conducted using appropriate metrics, such as the F1 score.


## Results
Accuracy Score for Logistic Regression is 0.977 and F1 score is 0.970
